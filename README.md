# tunefind.bundle
A WIP project to add movie "theme" music to Plex for movies and games (RetroArcher). This is not working yet.

Will attempt to utilize [tuenfind.com](https://www.tunefind.com) to get preview songs from apple music and apply to movies/games in Plex media server. Probably will only work for more modern games that have real sound tracks.

Movies browse page (https://www.tunefind.com/browse/movie)
Games browse page (https://www.tunefind.com/browse/game)

May need a server running and a way for users to upvote/downvote songs for each movie/game, as songs appear in order they appear in the movie/game instead of based on whether it is a theme song.
